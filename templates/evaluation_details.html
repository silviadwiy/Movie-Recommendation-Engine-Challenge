<p>Submissions are evaluated on <b>AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve).</b> This is a performance metric commonly used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers. A higher AUC-ROC generally indicates better classification performance. The sentiment labels are:</p>
<p>0 - negative<br>1 - somewhat negative<br>2 - neutral<br>3 - somewhat positive<br>4 - positive</p>

<p>For each phrase&nbsp;in the test set, predict a label for the sentiment.&nbsp;Your submission should have a header and look like the following:</p>
<pre>PhraseId,Sentiment<br>156061,2<br>156062,2<br>156063,2<br>...</pre>
